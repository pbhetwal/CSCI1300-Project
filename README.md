CU Boulder CSCI 1300 Project
### Project Details 
This project is for a simple model of a restaurant. 
#### 1) It will show the user a menu
#### 2) Allow them to pick items from this said food menu 
#### 3) Ask for the user's name
#### 4) Then, write their total to a file for our own use and also tell them their total 
Tax will be taken into consideration and the user will be asked if they would like to tip (although usually a restaurant does not ask for tips but I felt this added a little bit more to this project). Tax is currently set to 8% within main.cpp. The goal of this project was to create an amusing yet simplified simulated restaurant experience while also allowing a "business" to acquire information that may help them track their progress/success and/or improve their business. 
### Running the Program 
1) Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/pbhetwal/CSCI1300-Project.git` . 
2) Open a terminal within the directory and run `g++ main.cpp`.
3) Run `./a.out`.
