CU Boulder CSCI 1300 Project
### Project Details 
This project is for a simple model of a restaurant. It will show the user a menu, allow them to pick from the menu of food what
they would like to get, ask for their names and ask if they have any suggestions that could be added to the menu, and then write their total to a file and also tell them their total. Tax will be taken into consideration and the user will be asked if they would like to tip (although usually a restaurant does not ask for tips but I felt this added a little bit more to this project). Tax is currently set to 8% within main.cpp. The goal of this project was to create an amusing yet simplified simulated restaurant experience while also allowing a "business" to acquire information that may help them track their progress/success and/or improve it.
